# 🌐 Personal Web Developer Portfolio

This is my personal portfolio website built using *HTML*. It showcases who I am, the projects I've worked on, the skills I have, and how to contact me.

I created this as part of my journey to become a full-stack developer and eventually a game developer. This site will evolve over time as I learn *CSS, **JavaScript*, and other technologies.
